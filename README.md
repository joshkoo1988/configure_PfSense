- <b>PfSense</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

1. With a fresh install of PfSense I like to configure a few things first and we will be walking through that in this guide<br>

2. First I would recomend setting up a new user and password just for security purposes to do that ....

3. Second I would recomend setting up your subnet mask range for most 255.255.255.0 should be enough which will provide you with 253 useable IP's in your IP range

4. Next I would set up a private IP for your network which would range from (10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255) , (172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255) , (192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255)

5.
